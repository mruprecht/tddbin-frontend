# Code Editor
- write more efficient code using shortcuts, useful refactoring, etc.
- push changes automatically to github on red/green state change
- reveres mapping of test code to production code, to see where is something that is tested implemented
- collabrative editing, so everyone can use his own computer but collaborate
- time counter that shows "your tests are already RED for 23mins"
- "pair programming feauture" toggle actor icons to identify changing the driver and navigator role
- provide some badges to earn for some great solutions/tests/ideas/whatever, eg. "Monster Tester Badge"
- show badges on facebook/twitter for the user

# Complexity/Analysis
- show code complexity using TPP
- show coding session stats like: red-to-green time, complexity changes over time

# CodeRetreat features
- build in contraints detection, e.g. if constraint "no IFs" is selected, TDDbin will warn if violated
- build in pairing/collaboration rules, e.g. switch write access on certain conditions (ping pong, switches write access always on the next green state)
- create a kata-log, where katas can be chosen and be programmed
- maybe 1st paste kata descriptions into editor as comments
- categorize katas by levels (beginner, intermediate, refactoring, ...)
